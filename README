BinFind

  Description: Execute a binary search tree on an array of sorted items.

  Takes three arguments, 
  1) `array` : an array containing the items to be searched, 
  2) `block` : a function which acts like an iterator and returns a set of values in an array for comparison, and 
       - block() should return an array of three values.  The first and last values work as a range, and the binary search tries to find 
         the value in the array that causes the middle number to fall within the range.
         Thus, returning [1,2,3] indicates that the solution has been found, returning [1,0,3] will cause the search tree to shift to the right,
         and returning [1,4,3] will cause it to shift to the left. 
  3) `start_pointer` : optional, a numeric index in the array, if you wish to begin the binary search at a point other than the center of the array
